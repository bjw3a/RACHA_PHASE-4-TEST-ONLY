# Racha 2.0 — Phase 4

- Five required activities: Match-Up → Recognition → Typing → In Context → Story Challenge. Each requires at least 80%; matching uses five of six first attempts. Replay remains available.
- Speed Round and 60-Second Challenge removed from the required path. Their underlying engine code and historical records remain. Three Lives becomes ten untimed typing questions; Streak becomes five sentence completions with a word bank drawn from the selected topic’s existing passage.
- Recognition always uses choices. Typing always uses an input. Directions match the answer language. Context uses Spanish sentence completion; the final challenge retains reading comprehension.
- Case, vowel accents, apostrophe variants and sentence punctuation are optional in typed answers. Unicode normalization handles decomposed accents; ñ remains distinct. Answers require exact normalized matches; wrong conjugations remain wrong.
- English sentence translations inherit appropriate punctuation from their Spanish originals. Questions display question marks. Vocabulary labels remain labels.
- Homepage emphasizes Continue Learning and course selection. Stats and achievements are collapsed. Units and topics remain freely accessible.
- Continue Learning saves the last started topic and opens its next unmastered activity. Completed topics open their summary and replay list. Old Phase 3 data did not record a last-used topic; start one activity to establish a resume location.
- Topic completion includes course, unit, topic, date and best mastery for every required activity. Optional name is used only in the current summary. Copy button includes a manual selection fallback for restricted clipboard access. Schoology submission and screenshots remain student actions.
- Existing localStorage key, XP, badges, personal records and valid earned mastery are retained. Old mastery of the retained activities is honored without requiring students to repeat them. Retired activity mastery is also retained. Dates are recorded on new completion; earlier undated completions are labeled date unavailable.
- Removed Spain plural pronouns and conjugations from both courses and all generated choice pools. Formal singular SER examples use “usted ___ profesor.”
- No accounts, services, database, build step, or deployment URL changes.
